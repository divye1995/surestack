# Goals

### The Begining

I started this project as an Idea to merge many of my individual projects into one Super App that I could us to show what cool stuff I have built. But even while formalizing the app I realised I wanted to write much more than just another Web app.I have always like the feeling when I m writing any code in Javascript,when I reuse my code in another project or between my app and server code.The Delight of reusability and also partially motivated by my laziness, I wanted to create a project that embodies Reusability in terms of structure and end goals and also becomes a source many Open sourced components which are developed with the same principle at Mind. With that I want to lay the goals of Surestack as a project.

## Main Goals

1. Create a base project that is built with Reusability and Modularization in mind. 
2. To create a Super App that demos various Sub apps that are or will be part of this project while also serving as a boilerplate for any developer who wants to create their own Portfolio App.
3. To create Each Feature,Component and Utility with keeping the Questions asked in the [Reusability Playbook](./PLAYBOOK.md)
4. To create a feature/components/utilities that are fun to develop and are usefull to others.

## Key ideas 

1. Deliver features highly incrementally
2. Create Simple features with Testability a key component of the design.
3. Avoid adding features which need tight integrations or require use authentication to promote ease of discoverability.
4. Deeply focus on the quality of code added.
